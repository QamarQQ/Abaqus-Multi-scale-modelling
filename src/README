Extraction.m - Data from abqus is converted to a matrix with the elements, its corresponding nodes, energy and euler angles

EngGrad.m - Output of Extraction.m is used as input. Returns a matrix with the energy gradients and the misorientation angle 
(radians) (Symmetry not accounted for)

FinalDataForm.m - Output of EngGrad is used as input. Finds the average energy at every misorientation angle.

PlotAll.m - Output of EngGrad and FinalDataForm is used as input for the scatter and normal plots

Coorelation.R - Output of EngGrad and FinalDataForm is used as input for the correlation value, correlation plots and box plots

timer3.m - To calculate the time taken and the number of grain boundaries (unique and repeated) for given number of grains
